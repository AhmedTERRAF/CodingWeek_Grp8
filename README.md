Predicting Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Outcomes

âž¤ 1. Overview

This project aims to predict patient survival outcomes after Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) using machine learning models. By leveraging clinical and laboratory data, our goal is to provide a data-driven approach to assist medical professionals in assessing post-transplant prognosis.

âž¤ 2. Objectives

Develop a machine learning pipeline for predicting survival outcomes.

Address class imbalance in medical datasets.

Utilize explainability techniques (SHAP) to interpret model predictions.

Provide a front-end application for user interaction with predictions.
